# Website for Jean C. Flanagan

Jean is a science education specialist and writer. The site is designed with a content-first approach â€“ particularly focused on readability.

This is a collaborative project created by Oliver Pattison and Jean Flanagan. Design, concept and structure are primarily by Oliver, while content is all Jean's. The site is built using (hopefully) modern, standards-compliant HTML and CSS, as a static Jekyll site.

All content is authored by Jean Flanagan.

### Goals

- Repository for writing and other content for Jean
- Static HTML site built using Jekyll
- Semantic, maintainable HTML
- Mobile-first CSS
- Responsive, high performance design
- Optimized for readability at all screen sizes
- Few images except for photo content, mostly typography and simple styles

### Content

- Writing index
    - Self-published content
    - Content published elsewhere
- Photography
    - Photosets of 1-10 photos
- About page

### Implementation Details

- The entire site was designed intentionally around *real* written content and no ipsums or fillers.
- A drive towards minimalism influenced the initial design of the site. The site is built around the most basic and spare forms, with a content-first ethic.
- On smaller screens, navigation is handled using a footer-anchor pattern.
- Screens are important, but "mobile" and "tablet" devices aren't as much. The site's content and responsive features are shaped with smaller screens in mind first, but no particular device types are assumed at any given viewport width. Features are developed with touch and mobile capabilities in mind, but not with the feature-sets or designs of today's devices specifically.
- Limit use of plugins and JavaScript except where absolutely required.
- No fancy responsive image tricks, just ~1.5-2x scaled images (known as the "compressive images" solution) with heavy optimization. Optimization includes lowering JPEG quality, automated image optimization as a part of the build process, while retaining larger heighs and widths for images. Why? There will not be enough images to justify a JavaScript or `<picture>` solution. Most images will be relatively small in file size, and larger feature images will be worth the size/performance trade-off on high resolution screens. More and more browsers will be working in a pixel-multiplied environment of 1.5x or greater in the future, and almost all mobile devices already do.

### Requirements
