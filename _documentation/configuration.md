## Glossary

### Terminal

A conventional command line interface (CLI) in OS X that gives you far more power over your system and processes than you would have otherwise. A bit of CLI use is pretty much required for running Jekyll, Git and Rake, but there are ways to get around it for some tasks.

### Git

The version control system that manages the entire past and present of the site. [Git](http://git-scm.com) keeps a running log of commits to the site repository, containing not just the present state of the site, but also all of the changes. Git enables a distributed workflow so that multiple contributors can work on the project side-by-side.

### Repository

The entire site in a single directory. Version control of the files in the repository is handled by Git.

### Jekyll

[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) is a static site generator written in Ruby that builds static HTML (and CSS and XML and more) from plain text files and configuration files that tell Jekyll what to build. Jekyll can be installed on your local machine and commanded from Terminal. The static site can be deployed to a web server. Important files and folders in a Jekyll site:

- `_posts` – where blog-style posts are generated from Markdown files.
- `_layouts` and `_includes` help build templates for the site.
- `_plugins` – advanced configuration for the site.
- `_config.yml` is the main configuration file for the Jekyll site.
- `index.html` – every website needs one!

### Markdown

[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) is a minimal plain text writing format that can be converted directly into HTML. Most of the content for this site is written in Markdown. Note: you don't have to use Markdown for a Jekyll site, but it can help!

### Ruby

[Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) is a programming language that runs Jekyll. Ruby is *required* to be installed to run Jekyll. All of the plugins for this site are written in Ruby, but nothing else in the repository needs to be. Jekyll and Ruby do all the heavy lifting to build the site.

### Liquid

[Liquid](http://liquidmarkup.org) is a templating engine built into Jekyll that allows for helpful features like conditional content and HTML templating. This site's design leans very heavily on Liquid templating.

### YAML

[YAML](http://www.yaml.org) is a data format that can be embedded in most Jekyll files (such as Markdown or HTML documents), while also globally configuring the Jekyll site in the `_config.yml` file. YAML can holds metadata in the front matter of these files, which can be used to determine things like the published date, title and template layout of a post (default Jekyll configuration) or more advanced information like excerpt metadata for that post (custom Jekyll configuration).

### Rake/Rakefile

[Rake](http://rake.rubyforge.org) is a tool written in Ruby that builds things to your specification. A Rakefile is written which contains the commands (written in Ruby) which are executed when called from the command line. An example of this would be using the command `rake post` to generate a blank post from a template.

### Amazon S3

[Amazon's Simple Storage Service (S3)](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/) hosts every file on the site. S3 is relatively inexpensive, highly scalable storage that can also serve static websites via HTTP. This site is deployed to two S3 "buckets" (piles of files) which are immediately available publicly on the web. One bucket hosts the main site and the other hosts other static content like images. `s3_website` (used in the Terminal directly or via a Rake command) deploys the site to S3.

## How metadata in Jekyll works

Metadata is referred to in nearly any Markdown or HTML file with **YAML front matter**, a form of metadata for that page which is stored in protected blocks (typically with `---` opening and closing that code block). Whatever lies in between the markers is treated by Jekyll as YAML *instead of being treated as the native file format such as HTML*. YAML has **keys** and **values** that look like this: `title: 'Can marine phytoplankton evolve to cope with ocean acidification?'` The key is on the left and the value is on the right. Here is an example of how it works:

### Metadata with Liquid variables

To select the title for a particular page, we can set the HTML for a page like this: `<title>{{ page.title }}</title>`. This Liquid output variable inserts the `title` for the parent `page`. `title` is a YAML metadata **key**, and `page` refers to the type of layout. In this case, the **value** asigned to `page.title` is returned to the generated HTML document.

## How Liquid includes work

This is how the navigation is inserted into the `fundamental.html` file (the main layout called by all other layouts in the `_layouts` directory):

`{% include site-nav.html %}` (this is a Liquid **tag** and does not resolve to text)

By asking Liquid to **include** the `site-nav.html` file, we are pulling that file from the `_includes` folder in the Jekyll repository. This will take whatever HTML code is stored in that file and insert it into the `fundamental.html` file. By adding multiple includes and layouts together, we can generate a full HTML document, built out of condtional and template-driven content.

## How Liquid content works

`{{ your text here }}` (this is Liquid **output markup** and may resolve to text)

All that needs to be done to insert Markdown or raw HTML into a Jekyll document is to insert `{{ content }}`. This takes whatever content is included (perhaps a raw file from `_posts` or instead a parent layout.) Here's the trick: calling a parent layout in the YAML front matter (like `layout: fundamental.html`) will include that parent layout *as well as* any other layout or include code that make up that layout.

## How Liquid layout works

Here is what goes into the layout for a standard writing post (starting backwards from the layout file):

**The layout file `writing.html` pulls in:**

- `writing-meta.html`
- `{{ content }}` (from the post Markdown file)
- `post-nav.html`

**And pulls from:**

- `fundamental.html` (*another* **parent** layout)

**Which pulls in:**

- `{{ page.title }}` (pulled from the page metadata itself)
- HTML head matter:
  - `head-styles.html`
  - `head-icons.html`
  - `head-subscribe.html`
  - `head-scripts.html`
  - `head-fonts.html`
  - `head-analytics.html`
- HTML body matter:
  - `site-header.html`
  - `site-nav.html`
  - `site-footer.html`

I will stop digging here (one layer deep), not that it gets *that* much deeper than this, but it does get slightly more complex. The important part to understand is that if you find out what a page layout is made of and which other Liquid layouts and includes it depends on, you can find out exactly what elements are needed to construct similar layouts. In general, the `fundamental.html` layout is the core of the site and can be used for any sort of page. Other layouts should call this layout.

*Note: a Jekyll site will fail to build if a layout or include is called with a tag without a file to match that name.*

### Why organize a Jekyll site this way?

Modularity. By being able to reuse or conditionally use a layout or include file, we can control the output of the Jekyll site more cleanly and without rewriting code. Let's say we don't want Google Analytics tracking on a page. Or let's say we have to create a custom layout that requires different navigation. In these cases, the only customization necessary is creating a new layout or adjusting an include rule. If we need to add code, we create a new include module to be included wherever it is needed. If we want that new feature on every page on the site, we place that include in the `fundamental.html` file and it is available *on every page* when we build the site. If we want a certain feature only on a single page type, we can restrict its presence to only that page type by modifying that page's layout.

Other forms of page-specific content or features can be expressed with conditional Liquid tags and loops, but that is a different approach that can be used alongside and within includes and layouts.

## HTML

The site is written in semantic and structured HTML, adhering as closely as possible to [HTML5 specification](http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/) ([see also the WHATWG living standard](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/)). Some of the HTML is generated by Kramdown, a Markdown processor that Jekyll uses.

## Style

The CSS for the site is the key to the responsive behavior of the site, with default styles defining layout and typography for small screens first. This is known as "mobile-first" CSS, and it was designed "content-first" (with layout and other styles built around existing content blocks). Media queries are CSS rules that ask a client browser about the size of its viewport and serve conditional styles based on that query. Larger screens are assigned wider horizontal media queries, which provide different styles that overwrite some of the default "small screen" styles.

Any CSS selectors that are rewritten or reworked should take media queries into consideration, as small changes can have dramatic or unpredictable effects on how the site is rendered.

For ease of navigation, the CSS file is organized by section, with comments blocking out tiers of organization. These comment blocks are styled like headings in reverse, with `/*** ***/` being the top, first level and `/* */` being the third level. First level style blocks are noted at beginning *and* ending points, containing second and third level blocks. The main sections are:

1. Normalization
1. Basic structure and formatting
1. Component styles
1. Media queries
1. Print styles
1. Animations

Older browsers (like IE7 and IE8) *do not* support media queries, modern CSS, nor some HTML5 elements, which is why they are conditionally served a more minimal “non-responsive” stylesheet.

### Typography

[Adobe Typekit](https://typekit.com) serves fonts for the site. The site is set in Calluna (serif) and Open Sans. An include file called `head-fonts.html` stores the standard Typekit JavaScript. If fonts need to be adjusted or changed, this code will need to be swapped out using the Typekit administration panel.

### Color

The colors for the site's CSS are stored in the `_config.yml` site config. [HSL](http://hslpicker.com) and [hex](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors#Hex_triplet) colors are stored in YAML, and then inserted in every color declaration in the CSS files for the site. Color declarations are written like this `{{ site.color.colorspace }}`.

For example:

`{{ site.green.hsl }}` generates the _site CSS color `hsla(138, 40%, 50%, 1)`

## Creating new posts

The site uses a custom Rakefile to simplify and standardize the creation of new posts. A template is auto-generated according to the Jekyll specification and this particular site's structure. The `rake post` command generates a new post with mostly empty metadata and converts the title to a Jekyll-standardized format (`yyyy-mm-dd-post-title.md`) and adds it to the `_posts` folder.

1. In a Terminal window, navigate to the project directory (default: `repos/jeancflanagan`).
1. Enter the command `rake post`.
1. When prompted, enter the name of the post as it should appear as a title.
1. When prompted, enter 'y' if it is a photo post or 'n' if it is not.
1. Open the post in a text editor. (One shortcut for this is to copy/paste the title of the post which is provided by the command line as `_posts/filename.md` and then enter the command `open _posts/filename.md`.)

The photo post type generates slightly different metadata than the standard writing type, since it has different requirements. An example of this is `summary_photo` which is the featured photo for the excerpts on the main and photo index pages. Certain metadata items are not optional such as `period` which is inserted as a rough timeframe (such as `July 2015`) for the main index excerpts.

The date/time generated is the exact moment of creation, but it can be edited afterward if desired. Edit the date/time in the post metadata *as well as the date in the Jekyll file name*.

### Creating a new post using Alfred

I created a workflow in Alfred that makes it easier to run common command line tasks such as Rake or Jekyll commands without needing to open a new Terminal process manually or remember as many commands. The syntax is:

`rake post` (starting to type the command and then tabbing will auto-complete) + `jeancflanagan` (the repo folder)

For the recipe to work by default, it requires that any repo it is supposed to work with is included in a directory called `repos` stored within the main user directory.

## Common problems

- **Jekyll site fails to build.** Don't commit anything to Git. Take a look at what has changed since the last Git commit, using diffs. Roll back if necessary. Look for problems such as missing files, particularly the layouts and includes that are used to build the site. Sometimes doing something novel or problematic with a post will cause the entire site to fail to build. Fix the post by comparing it with content from a known working post. *If one thing fails on a Jekyll site configuration, the site may not build at all, but it is often something really small and easy to fix.*

- **Ruby doesn't work in Terminal.** Jekyll will not work without Ruby. Check what version you have by entering the command `ruby -v` or `rvm current` (it should be 1.9.3 or later). Try `rvm list` to see other installed versions of Ruby (if any), making sure that the default and current settings look correct.
